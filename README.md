# Nullable

**Motivation**.
We are not happy with
[Java Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) because is uncomfortable. 
Nullable is suggesting to do almost exactly and clearly.

You can build a jar file of the current snapshot version.
Make sure your branch builds without any warnings/issues:

```
mvn clean install -Pqulice
```
